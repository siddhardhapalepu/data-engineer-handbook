Below is a **completed** version of Experiment 1, including leading and lagging metrics. In addition, you’ll find **two more experiment ideas** (Experiment 2 and Experiment 3) to fulfill the requirement of proposing three experiments in total—each with a hypothesis, null hypothesis, test plan, and metrics. Feel free to customize any details as you see fit.

# Product: Instagram

## Brief User Journey Recap
- **First usage (15+ years ago)**: Initially joined to share casual daily photos—places I visited, food I ate, interesting visuals.  
- **Building a photography page**: Leveraged my passion for photography and started posting curated street/city photos.  
- **Noticing negative impacts**: At times, Instagram became distracting. Also concerned about the mental health effects on younger audiences.  
- **Current usage**: Alternate between actively sharing photography and uninstalling the app when I need to be more focused or avoid distractions.

## Experiment 1: Parental Controls for Teen Accounts

### Hypothesis
By introducing robust parental controls (time limits, content filters, usage reports, etc.) for teenage accounts, **parents will feel more confident** about their teens’ Instagram usage. This will:
- Reduce negative mental health impacts on younger users.  
- Decrease public/social media backlash on Instagram’s effect on teens.  
- Potentially increase **overall user retention** (both parents and teens) due to increased trust in the platform.  
- Possibly open a small premium revenue stream (if certain features are paid).

### Null Hypothesis
No significant change in:
- User sentiment around teen mental health.  
- Reduction in negative chatter regarding Instagram’s impact on teens.  
- Additional revenue or user acquisition due to this feature.

### Experiment Details
1. **Countries / Buckets**: 
   - 4 test markets: **USA, Canada, Mexico, India**.  
   - Within each market, **25%** of new teenage account sign-ups + 25% of existing teen accounts see the **“Enhanced Parental Controls”** feature.  
   - The remaining 75% continue with the **existing** version of the product (control group).

2. **Test Allocation**:
   - **Test Cell (25%)**: New feature enabled (parents can set time limits, restrict content categories, view usage dashboards).  
   - **Control Cell (75%)**: No additional parental controls; standard Instagram experience.

3. **Implementation Notes**:
   - **Account Linking**: Teen accounts link to a parent’s Instagram (or phone number/email) to manage settings.  
   - **Notification**: Teens get a pop-up that “Your parent wants to set boundaries on your usage.”  
   - **Optional Premium**: Some advanced controls (e.g., real-time usage stats, remote log-off) could be offered as a paid monthly subscription.

### Leading Metrics (Short-Term Indicators)
1. **Feature Adoption Rate**  
   - \% of eligible parents who activate parental controls within the first week of availability.  
2. **Time-on-App Reduction for Teens** (if time limit is enforced)  
   - Compare average daily minutes on Instagram for test vs. control groups.  
3. **Opt-in Rate for Premium Tier** (if relevant)  
   - \% of parents who decide to pay for enhanced controls.  
4. **Initial Sentiment / Feedback**  
   - In-app feedback surveys (like or dislike of new feature).  
   - Social media mentions or direct feedback referencing parental controls.

### Lagging Metrics (Long-Term Indicators)
1. **Teen User Retention**  
   - Compare 30-day and 90-day retention rates for teen accounts in test vs. control.  
2. **Parent NPS (Net Promoter Score)**  
   - Run surveys to see if parents are more likely to recommend Instagram knowing they can manage teen usage.  
3. **Brand Sentiment & Public Chatter**  
   - Monitor overall brand sentiment (e.g., third-party tools, sentiment analysis on social platforms) specifically around teen mental health concerns.  
4. **Paid Subscription Revenue (if introduced)**  
   - Track month-over-month revenue growth from premium parental control features.  
5. **Teen Well-Being Signals** (Longer term)  
   - Potentially gleaned from reduced negative events, fewer self-harm or bullying reports (if that data is trackable in aggregate).

## Experiment 2: Mindful Usage Nudges

### Rationale
Instagram usage can sometimes spiral into time-wasting or doomscrolling. Offering mindful usage nudges (like reminders to take breaks or highlight screen time) may help users control consumption.

### Hypothesis
If Instagram introduces **mindful usage nudges** (e.g., a gentle popup after 30 minutes of continuous scrolling prompting a break), this will:
- Increase user satisfaction in the long run (people feel more in control).  
- Decrease average session length but **increase** overall retention (fewer burnouts).  
- Improve brand perception as a “health-conscious” social media platform.

### Null Hypothesis
No meaningful improvement in user satisfaction or brand perception. Users might ignore or disable the nudge, leading to no net change in usage patterns.

### Experiment Details
1. **User Segments**: Randomly assign **50%** of global users to see mindful usage nudges after a set threshold of continuous scrolling.  
2. **Test Cell**: Nudges enabled (time-based pop-up, optional “snooze” button).  
3. **Control Cell**: No nudge; regular experience.

### Leading Metrics
- **Nudge Dismiss Rate**: How many users click “Dismiss” or “Snooze” immediately without changing behavior.  
- **Session Length Immediately After Nudge**: Do sessions actually shorten if a nudge is displayed?  
- **User Feedback**: Quick rating or feedback form after a week of seeing nudges.

### Lagging Metrics
- **Session Frequency / Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Over a multi-week period, do users come back more consistently if they aren’t burning out in single sessions?  
- **User Retention** (30-day, 90-day): Compare test vs. control to see if mindful usage fosters healthier long-term use.  
- **Brand Sentiment**: Monitor social and in-app feedback for mentions of “helpful feature,” “app is supportive,” etc.

## Experiment 3: Encouraging Positive Interactions

### Rationale
One cause of negative experiences on Instagram is the emphasis on likes/follows, which can lead to comparison or anxiety. Shifting the focus to **positive interactions** (e.g., kind comments, supportive reactions) might improve community health.

### Hypothesis
Introducing **quick “positive reaction” options** (like “Great shot!” or “Love this vibe!”) and awarding small badges for supportive interactions will:
- Increase positive comment frequency.  
- Improve perceived community well-being and user satisfaction.  
- Potentially reduce negative or spammy comments.

### Null Hypothesis
No significant change in comment sentiment. Users might ignore or abuse preset reactions.

### Experiment Details
1. **Allocation**: 20% of global user base sees quick positive reaction buttons under each post.  
2. **Test Cell**: Sees a new UI element with recommended positive phrases, an option to add a supportive sticker, and a “kindness badge” that increments after a certain number of positive interactions.  
3. **Control Cell**: Standard commenting and liking system.

### Leading Metrics
- **Positive Reaction Usage Rate**: \% of test group posts that include a preset positive comment or supportive sticker.  
- **Comment Length or Frequency**: Any uptick in meaningful comments (vs. single emoji or short phrases).

### Lagging Metrics
- **Comment Sentiment Score**: AI-driven analysis of comment positivity/negativity ratio.  
- **User Satisfaction**: Survey or Net Promoter Score changes among the test group.  
- **Reported Negative Interactions**: Track whether user reports of bullying/harassment decrease in the test group.
